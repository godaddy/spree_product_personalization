SpreeProductPersonalization
===========================

A <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree">Spree</a> extension that provides a way to add personalization to a product when adding it to the cart.

It follows the same technique used in another Spree extension <a href="https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_vouchers">spree_vouchers</a>.

Installation
------------

Add spree_product_personalization to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_product_personalization'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_product_personalization:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
